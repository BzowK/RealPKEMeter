# Real PKE Meter: Build Guide #

*This guide is currently under development*

## What You'll Need ##
**Parts**

Below are the exact parts I used.  Some may be substituted as desired, but code may need to be altered for them to work properly.

- x1 Arduino Nano *(Without headers preinstalled)*
- x1 DHT22 Sensor
- x1 SG90S Servo
- x14 3mm LEDs (20ma)
- x1 Piezo Speaker
- x1 0.96" OLED Display
- x2 330ohm Resistors
- x2 1M Resistors
- x1 Rotary Encoder /w Push Button
- x1 SPDT Toggle Switch
- x1 Powerboost 500 *(Without headers or ports  preinstalled)*
- x1 18650 Battery
- 3D printed parts
- 24 gauge wiring *(or stripped CAT5/CAT6 cable)*
- 22 gauge wiring *(optional?)*
- Shrink tubing

**Tools**

- 3D Printer *(or can order parts)*
- Soldering iron / solder
- Wire clippers / strippers
- Calipers or other measuring device *(Although I am located in the USA, this guide uses metric)*

## Important Notes ##

- I opted to not use a perfboard or custom PCB, but may design & add one in the future

- It is suggested (although not necessary) to test all components with code on a breadboard prior to assembly - especially if substituting parts.

# Procedure #
## Preparation ##
**1. Print or Order Parts**

**2. Prepare Hardware**

**3. Prepare Wiring**

Cut the wire lengths listed below...

*I used 22 gauge for everthing except where noted so that things fit correctly.  Noted colors do not matter & are used to keep straight their intention*

 - x14 150mm Yellow *(24 gauge)*
 - 

Using some of the above wires, solder the noted resistor inline between each noted pair - each resulting in a single cable.
