# Real PKE Meter: Build Guide#

*This project is currently under development*

## What You'll Need ##
**Parts**

Below are the exact parts I used.  Some may be substituted as desired, but code may need to be altered for them to work properly.

- x1 Arduino Nano
- x1 DHT22 Sensor
- x1 SG90S Servo
- x14 3mm LEDs (20ma)
- x1 Piezo Speaker
- x1 0.96" OLED Display
- x9 330ohm Resistors
- x2 1M Resistors
- x1 Rotary Encoder /w Push Button
- x1 SPDT Toggle Switch
- x1 Powerboost 500
- x1 18650 Battery
- 3D printed parts
- Wiring *(See below)*

***Note:** It is suggested (although not necessary) to test all components with code on a breadboard prior to assembly - especially if substituting parts.*

**Tools**

- 3D Printer *(or can order parts)*
- Soldering iron / solder
- Wire clippers / strippers
- Calipers or other measuring device *(Although I am located in the USA, this guide uses metric)*


# Procedure #
## Preparation ##
**1. Print or Order Parts**

**2. Prepare Hardware**

**3. Prepare Wiring**
Cut & strip both ends of the wire lengths listed below...

 - x1

Using some of the above wires, solder the noted resistor inline between each noted pair - each resulting in a single cable.
